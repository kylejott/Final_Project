## Introduction (1)

“Optimal” income taxation is always discussed against the background of *classic economic theories*: 

In a very recent work, @piketty2014inequality identify additional reasons why trends in top-income shares are correlated with the tax rates: 

- labor responses
- evasion/avoidance responses
- and bargaining responses. 

<br>
The current debate still lacks information about the top of the income distribution.

Our paper’s purpose is to identify anomalies in the tax patterns of ultra-wealthy Finnish people.
