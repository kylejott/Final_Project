## Introduction (1)
<style type="text/css">

</style>

“Optimal” income taxation is always discussed against the background of *classic economic theories*: 

In a very recent work, @piketty2014inequality identify additional reasons why trends in top-income shares are correlated with the tax rates: 

- labor responses
- evasion/avoidance responses
- and bargaining responses. 

<br>
The current debate still lacks information about the top of the income distribution.

Our paper’s purpose is to identify anomalies in the tax patterns of ultra-wealthy Finnish people.

## Our data (2)

- 70,402 observations (N = ~15,000 ; T = 5)

- Scraped all five years: 2009 to 2013

- Created time series dataset

- Created panel dataset using names as unique id's (N = 4867)

- Variables

    + Name
 
    + Total Income
 
    + Total Taxes Paid
 
    + Average Tax Rate
    
    + Rank

## Research Question

What is the responsiveness of reported taxable income to changes in average tax rates?

- Our research is motivated by the framework laid down by @gruber2002elasticity, @saez2004reported, and @giertz2007elasticity.

- @gruber2002elasticity and @giertz2007elasticity uses **panel data** to observe income elasticities. @saez2004reported uses **aggregated time series**.

- All of these papers look to observe long-term behavoiral elasticities, but given our dataset, we are only looking for **short-term** elasticies.

Model from @giertz2007elasticity

## Conclusion
Limitations:

- Limited expressiveness of average tax rates
- Only short-term elasticities (not long term)
- Lacking variables: marginal tax rates, controlling for other kinds of income, demographic controls, and marital status control
<br>


Further research needed!

- Panel fixed effects model
- Further robustness checks
- Comparison to other Scandinavian countries
- Investigating our counterintuitive result
